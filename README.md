Decentralized Freelance Marketplace
Project Description
The Decentralized Freelance Marketplace is a blockchain-based smart contract system that enables secure freelance transactions between clients and freelancers. The platform uses escrow functionality to hold payments until work is completed and approved, eliminating the need for intermediaries and ensuring trust between parties. Built on Ethereum using Solidity, this project provides a transparent, tamper-proof solution for freelance work agreements.

Protects both clients and freelancers through smart contract escrow
Eliminates middlemen and reduces transaction fees
Provides transparent and immutable work agreements
Empowers global workforce collaboration without borders
Ensures fair and timely payments through automated blockchain execution
